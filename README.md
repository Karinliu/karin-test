# Karin's savings app @to graduate


## The assignment
The assignment is to independently carry out a project. During the process it is important to show all CMD competences at graduation level with the exception of the competence "Multidisciplinary collaboration".

During the process there is a (potential) client, colleagues and experts involved. 

## My project
For my graduation project, I decided to start an independent project for an organization. The organization for whom I carried out a project is [Lijn5](https://www.ln5.nl/).

## My concept
My concept is to let a user with Intellectual disability learn to manage money. When the user wants to buy something, then the application can be used.

A category can be chosen that the item belongs to. After that, a question is asked whether there is enough money. If the answer is "Yes", a list will be developed. If the answer is no, the application will be encouraging the user to save money.
